## Team Roles

| Person        | Role |
| ------------- | ---- |
| Jai       | Will lead the development of Junit testers, focusing on the authentication functionality. This will ensure the login process is working correctly. Jai is also writing the documentation needed for these sprints. Jai will help Kris on the testers that he writes if help is needed.|
| Andrew     | Will lead setting up the database and the management using MySQL. Given the interconnectedness of authentication and database management, Jai and Andrew will work closely together to ensure tests are integrated seamlessly. |
Callum      | Will lead developing the front end. Focusing on the user-facing aspects of the GP Booking system. The most important part of this being separating the functionality and visuals apart from each other. Working with the backend developers to make sure that it is as easy as possible to pass information from the front-end to the back end, and vice versa. |
| Kris       | Kris is also focusing on the testers; he will be assisting with Jai and his work. He is also designated to helping out others when it is needed. |
| Louis     | full-stack development. Will work closely with both Callum and Andrew to ensure their assigned work is completed. Also, will ensure that the back end/front-end connections are concurrent. |
| Everyone  | If there is a member of the team struggling on an issue, and all other responsibilities are completed by one of the team members, they have the choice to help on another feature of the system. We will track who has worked on each part of the system by their contributions on the git history as well as GitLab Issues. Every |

## Meetings 
* In addition to the mandatory weekly software development seminars, we will make sure to meet up at least once a week, therefore seeing each other for 2 x 1 hour meeting sessions. If a meet up in person is not possible, we will meet online, over a voice call, using Discord.
* In the final meeting for the first sprint, we will meet as a team to double check through everything implemented and ensure it all works correctly. If successful we will celebrate the completion of all the features planned.
